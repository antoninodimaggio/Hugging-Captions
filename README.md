<i>Photo is from Rocky Mountain National Park</i>

Captions for the above photo generated by Hugging Captions (the last one is amazing). Trained with #rmnp captions. Captions generated using the prompt "The view".
* The view from the top of the mountain - one of our favorite hikes in Rocky Mountain National Park.
* The view is stunning in all its glory! 💕🍃
* The view of the chasm opens up once more when the vast expanses of the Rocky Mountains re-emerge into the background like the morning sun behind the tree line! #rmnp

## Introduction

Hugging Captions fine-tunes [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/), a transformer-based language model by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), to generate realistic captions. The model is trained using cleaned caption data obtained from realevant instagram hashtags. The fine-tuned model generates captions given a starting prompt of about 2-5 words. All of the transformer stuff is implemented using [Hugging Face's Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

## Requirements
* A CUDA enabled device ~ (I used version 10.2)
* Python 3.6 ~ (not sure about compatibility with other Python 3 versions)
```
git clone https://github.com/antoninodimaggio/Hugging-Captions.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/antoninodimaggio/instagram-scraper.git@hugging_captions
```

## Download and Clean The Data
* Make sure that the hashtag you choose has a decent amount of posts (>=5000) and is relevant to the photo you want to generate a caption for. This is very important.
* Detailed information on each argument can be found [here](DOCS.md)
* You could also use python pull_and_clean.py -h for help
```
python pull_and_clean.py --tag <some hashtag> \
    --caption-queries <number of queries> \
    --min-likes <min number of likes>
```

## Fine-tune The Model
* Now that we have our training data we can fine-tune our transformer-based language model.
* I trained my model with ~3000 lines of text on one GeFore RTX 2080 TI with 11019MiB of available memory. This took less than 5 minutes. GPU memory can be an issue.
* Detailed information on each argument can be found [here](DOCS.md)
* You could also use python tune_transformer.py -h for help <br><br>
Just fine-tune the model which is saved at ./trained_models/somehashtag/
```
python tune_transformer.py --tag <some hashtag> --train
```
Just generate captions which are written to ./text/generated_text/somehashtag_gen.txt
```
python tune_transformer.py --tag <some hashtag> --generate \
    --max-length <max length of caption> \
    --min-length <min length of caption>
```
Fine-tune and generate at the same time
```
python tune_transformer.py --tag <some hashtag> --train --generate \
    --max-length <max length of caption> \
    --min-length <min length of caption>
```

## Future Work
* Explore ways to better clean caption data both generated and training
* Explore different pre-trained language models
* Fine-tune models using caption data from mutiple realevant hashtags
